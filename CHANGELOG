# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

### Known Issues
-Program crashes when uploading a second file (unknown cause) (medium prio)

### Fixed 
-Fixed bit depth and sample rate combo box conversion issues -- file now converts appropriately

### To Be Added
-Timelapse circle on the chart so that the user can visually "see" where the sound is with respect to the x and y axis of the plot
-Tuning dial so that the user can add a time delay for when the .wav file is being played (slow down the timelapse circle)
-Integrate upsampling / downsampling -- figure out the best method for this application / best overall UI for ease of use for the user

### Added
-Open File push button added which opens a new window for the user to select a .csv OR .wav file
-Export File push button added which utilizes the .csv file (must use the open file button first to open the .csv file) in which this .csv file will be converted into a .wav file
-Added Bit Depth and Sample Rate dropdown menus for the user to select while exporting their .csv file into a .wav file (make sure to select these first prior to exporting)
-Added Play / Stop / Pause buttons which Play / Stop / Pause the sound that is playing from the selected .wav file
-Added 5 dial switches which control Volume, Timbre, Time, Unison, and Reverb (Volume only one that is functioning correctly)

## [0.0.2] - 2024-09-18

### Removed
-Removed Timbre, Time, Unison, and Reverb dial buttons / LCD screens

## [0.0.3] - 2024-09-24

### Added
-Added a minimum and maximum datapoint value per .csv file that the user can upload (minimum 100 datapoints and maximum 50,000 datapoints)
-Added a chart push button which will open a separate window displaying a chart that outputs the datapoints 

## [0.0.4] - 2024-09-25

### Added
-Added a chart diagram when the user clicks on the "Chart" button which graphs the data linearly
-Added a Max Value and Datapoint # line edit section for the user to indicate the max value for the datapoints and the number of datapoints the file contains (this is for modifying the chart according to the x and y axis,
where the x axis is the number of datapoints in the file and the y axis is the max value of the datapoints)

## [0.0.5] - 2024-10-03

### Fixed
-Fixed .csv to .wav export conversion where the converted .wav file did not store the datapoints correctly and ultimately play the correct or any sound at all

## [0.0.6] - 2024-10-10

### Fixed
-Fixed combo box SampleRate and BitDepth as these values the user selects appropriately converts the .csv file to a .wav file without file corruption

## [0.0.7] - 2024-10-21

### Added
-Added Frequency (Hz) and Data Points labels / LCD screens / Horizontal sliders to the application which is utilized for the Resampling process
-Added various labels throughout the application [Resampling Tuners, WAV Configuration, Charting]
